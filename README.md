# terraform-aws-vpc
# Amazon AWS VPC

This Terraform configuration creates:
* Amazon AWS VPC
* Internet Gateway
* Subnets in all configured availability zones and routing tables linking them to the Internet Gateway

Additionally, if variable `private_subnets` is set to true, it will create:

* NAT with Elastic IP address in each availability zone
* Private subnet in each availability zone with routing tables linking them to the NAT

This configuration uses my own module.
